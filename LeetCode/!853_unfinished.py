# Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
# The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
# The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
# Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

# time: [1, 1, 12, 7, 3] 

# lower or equal time will combine
# i.e. cars 1, 2 and cars 4, 5
